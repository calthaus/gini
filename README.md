# gini

This repository contains the `R` code files for estimating and modelling Gini coefficients for sexually transmitted infections from the following publication:

- Gsteiger S, Low N, Sonnenberg P, Mercer CH, Althaus CL. (2018) [Gini coefficients for measuring the distribution of sexually transmitted infections among individuals with different levels of sexual activity](https://doi.org/10.1101/438127). bioRxiv 438127.

The Natsal data sets need to be downloaded from the [UK Data Archive](http://data-archive.ac.uk). You can then place them in the `data` directory as `natsal2.dta` and `natsal3.dta`.
